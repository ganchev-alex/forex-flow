# ðŸ’± ForexFlow â€“ Currency Management & Invoicing App

### ðŸª™ Introduction

ForexFlow is a lightweight desktop application built as part of a university course project, initially assigned by my professor. The idea behind ForexFlow is to provide a functional and intuitive platform for managing currencies, calculating conversions, tracking amounts, and generating basic invoices.

The app is designed to give users a hands-on experience with handling foreign exchange data and practical financial operations. It serves not only as a useful tool but also as a demonstration of key software engineering principles.

ForexFlow is a WPF application developed using the .NET framework, showcasing my familiarity with C#, Entity Framework, and established architectural patterns such as MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). The project also follows the Repository Pattern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

This project allowed me to explore the essentials of desktop app development and data-driven UI binding, while also reinforcing my skills in object-oriented programming, database management, and software architecture design.

ðŸ§¾ Whether for coursework, a portfolio addition, or real-world currency/invoice handling, ForexFlow stands as a strong example of solid desktop app architecture in .NET.
